Data migrations for Mongoid. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations)

Gemfile:
```ruby
gem "mongoid_rails_migrations"
```

# How to use

Create migration
```
$ rails generate mongoid:migration <your_migration_name_here>
```

Run migrations:
```
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:migrate:down VERSION=
$ rails db:migrate:up VERSION=
$ rails db:rollback
$ rails db:rollback_to VERSION=
$ rails db:migrate:redo
$ rails db:migrate:reset
$ rails db:migrate:status
$ rails db:reseed (handled by mongoid)
$ rails db:version
```

To override default migrations path (`db/migrate`), add next line to your `application.rb` file:
```
Mongoid::Migrator.migrations_path = ['foo/bar/db/migrate', 'path/to/db/migrate']
```
