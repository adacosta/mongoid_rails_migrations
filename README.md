# Data migrations for Mongoid. [![Build Status](https://github.com/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Gemfile:
```ruby
gem "mongoid_rails_migrations"
```

Create migration
```
$ rails generate mongoid:migration <your_migration_name_here>
```

Run migrations:
```
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:migrate:down VERSION=
$ rails db:migrate:up VERSION=
$ rails db:rollback
$ rails db:rollback_to VERSION=
$ rails db:migrate:redo
$ rails db:migrate:reset
$ rails db:migrate:status
$ rails db:reseed (handled by mongoid)
$ rails db:version
```

If you want to use output migration use the hook `after_migrate`
```
Mongoid::Migration.after_migrate = ->(output, name, direction, crash) {
  upload_to_s3(name, output, direction) if crash == false
}
```

To override the default migrations path (`db/migrate`), add the following line to your `application.rb` file:
```
Mongoid::Migrator.migrations_path = ['foo/bar/db/migrate', 'path/to/db/migrate']
```

## Multi databases support

Default behavior is to store migrations in the `default` client database but for projects that require horizontal scalabilty, this gem supports migrations [sharding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_\(database_architecture\)).

To generate a migration that can be run on shards, suffix the migration generator command with `--shards` like:

```
$ rails generate mongoid:migration <your_migration_name_here> --shards
```

The migration will be created and stored in `db/migrate/shards` folder.

With the following configuration:

```yaml
production:
  clients:
    default:
      database: my_production_db
      hosts:
        - 4.2.4.2:27017
    shard1:
      database: my_shard1_production_db
      hosts:
        - 5.3.5.3:27017
    shard2:
      database: my_shard2_production_db
      hosts:
        - 6.4.6.4:27017
```

In order to manage a sharded migration, run tasks with the `MONGOID_CLIENT_NAME` environment variable:

```
$ rails db:migrate MONGOID_CLIENT_NAME=shard2
```

The shards migrations will be executed and entries will be added in the `my_shard2_production_db` database.

All the rake tasks support the `MONGOID_CLIENT_NAME` environment variable.

To make shards migrations the default migration type, add the following line in your config:

```ruby
# config/application.rb

Mongoid.configure.shards_migration_as_default = true
```

Global migrations can still be created with the `--no-shards` option.
