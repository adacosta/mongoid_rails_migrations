Data migrations for Mongoid. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adacosta/mongoid_rails_migrations)

Gemfile:
```ruby
gem "mongoid_rails_migrations"
```

# How to use

Create migration
```
$ rails generate mongoid:migration <your_migration_name_here>
```

Run migrations:
```
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:migrate:down VERSION=
$ rails db:migrate:up VERSION=
$ rails db:rollback
$ rails db:rollback_to VERSION=
$ rails db:migrate:redo
$ rails db:migrate:reset
$ rails db:migrate:status
$ rails db:reseed (handled by mongoid)
$ rails db:version
```

To override the default migrations path (`db/migrate`), add the following line to your `application.rb` file:
```
Mongoid::Migrator.migrations_path = ['foo/bar/db/migrate', 'path/to/db/migrate']
```

# Using along side ActiveRecord migrations
If your rails app uses both `Mongoid` and `ActiveRecord` migrations then the migration files and rake tasks created by the two gems will cause conflict.
In order to resolve this add the following lines to your `application.rb` file:
```
Mongoid::Migrator.namespace = 'db:mongoid'
Mongoid::Migrator.migrations_path = ['db/mongoid']
```
With the above changes the generated migration files will be created under the `db/mongoid` path instead of the default `db/migrate` path and the rake tasks would change to:
```
$ rails db:mongoid:migrate
$ rails db:mongoid:migrate:down VERSION=
$ rails db:mongoid:migrate:up VERSION=
$ rails db:mongoid:rollback
$ rails db:mongoid:rollback_to VERSION=
$ rails db:mongoid:migrate:redo
$ rails db:mongoid:migrate:reset
$ rails db:mongoid:migrate:status
$ rails db:mongoid:reseed (handled by mongoid)
$ rails db:mongoid:version
```
If there are pre-existing Mongoid migration files under the `db/migrate` path then they'll have to be moved manually to the new path.
